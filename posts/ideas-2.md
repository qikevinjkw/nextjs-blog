- buymeacoffee is a great idea. But less friction for sign up. It uses $5 increments. But what about affiliate links instead. Or buying something off amazon for them. They have a wishlist. And you can contribute X amount to their wishlist and see where your contribution goes.
- similar to buymeacoffee, but for people's time. You determine how much your time costs. Put your available times in a calendar. And people can just buy your time and ask whatever they want.
- similar to buymeacoffee, but use QR codes so people can quickly use venmo, cash app, or wechat. Basically a good UI widget that can show your QR codes. It must be frictionless experience for both creators and users that pay. There is still friction with buymeacoffee, you need to enter your credit card.

- buymealunch/buymeadinner/treatmetodinner/bookasessionwithme - an opensource dev, or creator has a calendar of available slots. You can choose to book times with them and they can set an amount. Make a frictionless widget they can embed, some quick url. Write reviews on them.⭐
- sign in book. Tiny widget where users can post on a shared wall.
- embeddable widget with all your social media handles
- buymeagift - widget that let's you purchase an item on their amazon wish list
- I Often wish I could purchase swag from Vercel, or youtubers, or other open source projects. Because I'm proud to use their stuff, and want to help them. BUT, I'm not generous enough to do a recurring donation. I'd love to pay and buy something even if it's a bit more expensive. So not reucrring. And I get something back. Swag.
- Creators set payment milestones. They don't get the money until a milestone is reached
- QRSavings - You put money into our account. And we lock it away. We give it back to you with zero interest after a year.
