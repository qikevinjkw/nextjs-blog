On my way home from Costco, I drove over a pothole and my Tesla made a loud bang. I didn't think much about it, but by the time I got home, the pressure in one of my rear tires decreased noticeably. There was definitely some puncture wound in my tire.

So what I did was go into the Tesla mobile app, schedule a service appointment, and within few minutes a representative was texted me asking about my problem. I told her I needed to either repair or replace my tire and she said she'll see if someone is available today. Unfortunately they didn't have a tire for my model in stock until Sunday(this was a Friday and I needed to use my car the next day), but they would send over a technician to replace it with a loaner wheel so I could use it until Sunday. So within an hour, a guy in a van drove to my home and replaced my wheel with one that wasn't leaking air. The rep also told me how much it would cost to replace the wheel including labor fees. Talk about radical transparency and good customer service! With my previous Corolla, I would have had to search for car repair shops nearby, then look at their reviews. And after I found a good one, I had to call and schedule an appointment a few days out. And since the good shops are usually booked on the weekends, I would have had to take a half day off and take my car there for repair. Then if I got unlucky, I would get duped by them and they'd charge me for all these different costs.

Anyway.

On Sunday morning, a technician called and asked if I was available in the morning. I said I was and he came by around 10am. He took a look at my wheel and confirmed it was leaking air and needed to be replaced. Within 5 minutes he put a brand new wheel on my Tesla and that was it! I didn't even need to give him my credit card since they could use the one I had on file in my Tesla account which I used for supercharging. What an amazing experience. This is how car repairs should work!!!
