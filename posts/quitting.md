I'm going to quit my job. I don't have anything planned for next steps. So why am I quitting? I would say it's because I don't like the work I'm doing. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think there's a perfect job out there where I will like 100% of the work. But I'm looking for a good balance. Say a job where I like 70-80% of the works. Currently I'm developing web GUIs with React. Which is great. But lately I've been having to piece together internal tools and servers. Learning stuff that's useless like Q queries or working with this agGrid wrapper. Also having to work on this project I started when I first joined that uses Redux. And having to work with traders in Sydney where their 8am is my 6pm. Having a backlog of tasks to do. And if I don't maintain my efficiency I will fall behind.

Now those alone probably wouldn't be enough to convince me to quit my job. But I've been making some good progress on side projects lately. One is my personal blog that I'm pretty happy with. Second is this site for talking to coworkers anonymously. But after writing a bunch of code until 6-7pm, I just don't have the energy to work on side projects. My manager is constantly asking me what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis. And lately, two talented coworkers left, and I just don't feel like I'm surrounded by mentors or people that can help me grow. Yea there are strong devs on other teams, but I just use the stuff they build. I'm not really learning from them. And seeing a talented coworker get fired really affected my impression of the company. Like I see no future for myself there. Even if I become as technically talented as that guy, the result is getting fired? Like wtf. What motivation do I have to do a good job anymore?

And my pay is alright. 300k. But I want to take a chance. Take a gamble on myself. I know my abilities to produce results. But working hard and giving it my all at this company won't return results proportional to the time and effort I put in. At the end of the year, at most they'll give you a slight raise for all your hard work and tell you to keep it up. If I were to work on my own and develop and market a product, there's a lot more risk. But along with that is potential for a lot more reward.

One of my rules in life is to have no regrets. Life is too short for regrets. Don't do something you'll regret in life. Similarly, don't not do something you'll regret. I could work at my current role for another few years. But I feel like I can do that in the future. I'm confident I'll be able to find a similarly if not better job in the future. And I know the risks involved with working on my own. I don't gamble. But if I were to gamble, I'd definitely bet on myself.

Seeing a bunch of people leave the company also affected me. And knowing I'll get some non-compete is also nice. Being fortunate enough to have a US citizenship and financial buffer both from my savings and from my parents plays a big role too. I know many people from other countries that can't just leave their job because of their VISA status. So I know I am in a very fortunate position, and I'm not going to let that go to waste.

Some things I'll do once I leave.
