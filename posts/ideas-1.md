- asian version of Hinge, you rate other people on scale 1-10, others can rank you too in private. This helps algo. If you're rated a 5 on average, you'll get recommended a 4-6. Invite system like Clubhouse.
- video about what it's like working at my company
- anonymous app for professionals=blind anonymous app for whistleblowing. You can post any secret. Targeted at professionals. My manager blah blah blah.
- Anonymously post problem sets of tech companies. 一亩三分地 english version
- dating site for professionals. You use LinkedIn to sign in.
- language learning site/dating. You choose which language you want to learn. And if someone wants to learn a language you know, you two are potential matches. Example, I know Mandarin, English, I want to learn Japanese. Some girl who knows Japanese wants to learn English. She will show up in my list of potential matches.
- similar to angel parking, but a reward system that incentives users to post more actively about available parking, parking rules, pictures. You post a rule/picture/availability. If users say it's correct, you are rewarded a dollar and credibility.
- newsletter for new Youtube channels with potential or high quality content.
- You record yourself playing badminton, and a coach and review it for you. Solves: Hard to find badminton coaches.
- online marketplace for lesusons: focus on a specific area, maybe badminton or piano. Something that's suited for virtual.
- hard to monetize open source. Offer a frictionless way for open-source contributors to make money. If they contribute to repo X, then they are allowed to offer their time. Let's say I use AgGrid and need help, I can request some time and pay for it. Any questions can be saved and be put online to be shared with everyone else. A portion of it goes to the open source project. ⭐
