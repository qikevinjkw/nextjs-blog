- a light the randomly flickers depending on the weather
- an app that puts random todos on your list
- an app that rates your room

- no way to embed links in instagram posts. Some lame link on profile page. Make it better.
- why are feedback panels on major websites so badly designed. Bad UI. This can be improved dramaticlaly. check out costco.com. It opens a new window with bad UI. Lower the friction. Just a comment box and a way to give overall satisfaction.
- page where you can donate money to have potholes fixed, if a certain amount is reached, it will pay for the pothole.
- app that helps you memorize solutions to leetcode questions. Approach to leetcode should really be, know the approach/solution/algo first, then learn how to code it. Because coding it is easy once you know what to do.
