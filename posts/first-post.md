This is probably the furthest I've come in working on a personal side project. In the past, I'd always give up 1 or 2 days into it. What changed since then is this book I've been reading called [_Atomic Habits by James Clear_](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). It wasn't full of bullshit theoretical sentences like

> _"Believe in yourself"_  
> _"You need to want it bad enough"_

No, it gave practical examples of how to stick to a new habit. It was game-changing. I wish I read it when I was 18 instead of 28. I could have used his advice and achieved so much more.

The first habit I wanted to develop was to read more. To do this, I combined a couple of his tips.

1. Be precise about your new habit. Give location, time, and action details  
   I used to give myself vague tasks like _"work on a side project"_ or _"read more"_ or _"exercise more"_. But James said we need to make it more precise, down to the location and time. So I started telling myself, _"I am going to create a NextJS project, and go through their tutorial at 6pm tonight at my desk."_ and _"I am going to read 5 minutes of Atomic Habits at 10:30pm at my bed"_. And miraculously, it worked! It was clear what I needed to do and when and whhere to do it.

2. Leverage an existing habit  
   By chaining a new habit before or after an existing habit, it's easier to remember to do that new habit. For me, I had a habit of watching an episode of _Friends_ before I went to sleep. So I told myself, _"After I go to bed, I am going to read a book for 5-10 minutes, then I can watch Friends"_. Watching Friends was the reward, so it made me look forward to reading. I wasn't excited to be reading, but excited in _anticipation_ of the reward that came after. James mentions that humans gain more dopamine from the anticipation of a reward than when they actually receive it. So just knowing you'll be rewarded will make you motivated to do a task. This made reading before sleeping much easier.

3. It's about **quantity** not **quality**
   In an experiment, out of a classroom of 100 students, 50 were asked to submit 100 pictures throughout the semester, and the best out of their 100 pictures would be their final grade. The other 50 students were asked to submit one picture at the end of the semseter, and their final grade would be graded off of that one picture. Guess which group of students took the best pictures? Yep, the ones that submitted 100.  
   James notes that practicing through action drastically improved one's skills than preparing and learning to take the perfect shot.

4. Being in Motion vs. Taking Action
   When we are learning, there are two states we can be in. Being in motion means you're preparing, learning and strategizing. Taking action is the one that actually delivers results and outcomes.

- If I write down 10 ideas for side projects - that's motion. If I start writing code for a project - that's action.
- If I go through a lot of tutorials on new programming languages - that's motion. If I write a project or app myself in a language I know - that's action.
- If I do a lot of research on how to start a business - that's motion. If I create a website, create my first sale - that's action.
  > Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. Only taking action will get you the result you're looking for.

So why are most people stuck in motion? Because we're afraid of failure. Being in motion gives the illusion of making progress, without the risk of failure. You can't fail in a business if you're never started one. But you can feel like you're making progress towards starting your own business by doing risk-free research. Motion makes you _feel_ like you're getting shit done, but when preparation becomes a form of procrastination, things need to change.
