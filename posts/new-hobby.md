I played tennis for the first time since undergrad, and it was fun! We drove 20min north and there were a dozen courts there. We played with these cheap rackets we bought off Amazon. I was able to serve because that movement is similar to a smash in badminton. It was really fun! I feel like I have a new hobby to look forward to each week now.

This past week, I've been working on my personal website a lot lately. These past two days I got like functionality for posts working with some animation. And during the weekday, I got mobile-responsive design working. So far so good. I've been able to keep a habit of reading every day and coding side projects. I want to keep this up. 1% a day! Let's go!!!

What other new habits do I want? Nothing at the moment. I'm pretty satisfied with the two new hobbies I'm learning. The coding is taking a large chunk of my free time.
